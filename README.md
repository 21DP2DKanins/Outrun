# Outrun
####
Out Run is a three-dimensional racing video game in which the player drives a Ferrari Testarossa Spider with a third-person rear view. The camera is positioned close to the ground, simulating the position of the Ferrari driver and limiting the player's view to the distance. The road curves, rises and falls, increasing the difficulty of the game by hiding approaching obstacles, such as traffic that the player must dodge.
